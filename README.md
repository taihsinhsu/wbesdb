Website structure:

The website is composed five pages, which are "Building", "Climate", "Fields", "Solar" and "Energy."
The purpose of this website is to present a case in Shenzhen about its building physics of different aspects.
Users can explore the website to understand the climate of the local area, the basic information of the porject,
categories of building physics, solar analysis of the site and energy performance of the project.

Explore Website:

For the "Building" page, users can get the basic informations of the project, such as building height, location, and its' program.
From "Building" page, users can go to the "Climate" page. The climate page is aimed to give users an idea about
the weather of the project. The first thing to do for understanding a builidng energy performance is to know its' weather condition.
By knowing the weather condition, we can know this project is cooling directed or heating directed. For example, heating should be
the biggest part of whole building energy consumption in cold climate, like Boston. On the contrary, cooling will be the biggest pie
of whole energy consumption where project is located at Shenzhen becuse of hot climate.

The "Field" page is to provide an overview of building physics this dicipline. There are many factors can affect buildng performances.
Also, we can analyze the project from different perspectives. This page give usees an idea that under each category, there are
some sub-category to analyze the prject. It also provide a guideline of future developments. What other informatino can be added on.

The "Solar" page here is to show the sun path analysis under the daylight category. The simulation results show the sun path and
shadow range of four different time during a year. From this analysis, we can tell which orientation might not receive enough daylight.
Also, which orientatied facade will be covered by surroundings' shadow.

Sentative Analysis Result:

Finally, the "Energy" page, users can play with different combinaitons of building parematers, such as orientation, window to wall ratio,
and glass type. By selecting each parameter, users can see what is the final result of energy consumption. Users can also assign a range
of each parameters to see what's the range of result. The purpose of this graph is to show the sentative analysis. By playing these parameters,
users can understand which factor can have relevent impact on building performance.
