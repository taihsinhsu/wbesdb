        <p class="lead">This project is based on the information and data gathered from energy simulation of buildingsâ€™ performance. It has become increasingly important for buildings to be as efficient and as environmentally friendly as they can be. Here, a case study of a typical tall-hot-zero building is analyzed in various fields and metrics to help designers visualize the impact of their design choices.</p>
